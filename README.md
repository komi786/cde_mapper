# ![Uploading link_icon Background Removed.pngâ€¦]() CT\_Mapper: Automated Terminology Mapping of Clinical Terms to OMOP Vocabularies using Retrieval Augmented Generation: 
CT Mapper is an automated concept linking tool to find appropriate standardized terms in OMOP Athena vocabularies for clinical terms in data dictionary. The mapping tool is built with advanced Retrieval Augment Generation method. We leverage the power of generative models and vector store to improve accuracy of linking for composite concepts. This tool allows the data custodians to transform ambiogious and semi-structured clinical data to harmonized schema.

# Task Description
In order to harmonize clinical data, it is important to understand the varying lvel of conceptual representation in it. Many existing frameworks have tried to solve the challange of concept linking where  clinical terms witha atomic representation are considered only. Considering the challanges encountered in mapping cohort studies in [ICARE4CVD project](https://icare4cvd.eu), we attempt to solve this challange using retrieval augmented generation and in-context learning. Instead of mapping solo terms, we attempted to map data dictionaries (horizental table format) where each row is considered a single query. Each query may comprise of various components including label, description, method, formula, unit, categorical values etc. To standardize and extract clinical terms frome ach query, we utilized ICL with generative models (LLAMA, GPT4). For retrieval we used, hybrid vector search along with metadata filter on structured schema. The combined retirval method improves the precision
